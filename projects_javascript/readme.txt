-This is an exercise to improve on array iteration in the Code Academy website JavaScript course
- I decided to add to it a bit and plan on adding more.
-One thing i think this part of the course should of covered but didnt was creating lists or arrays with loops.
  -Ex. 
  var arr = [];

for (var i = yearStart; i < yearEnd+1; i++) {
    arr.push(i);
}
  -The course did cover .push() however didnt talk much about how it's used to make lists
  or how to make lists from lists etc.
  -The course did explain lists of objects pretty well.
